### Hi there 👋

I'm Nathanaël Cherrier. I'm a full-time software engineer passionate about writing clean, beautiful and well-designed code. On my free time, I try to give back to open source by maintaining open source projects and contributing to others.

I'm also a tech content creator. I write [tech posts, courses and tutorials to help people](https://mindsers.blog/) from beginner to advanced to learn and grow as a developer.

A few fun facts about me :
